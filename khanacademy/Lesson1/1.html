     <h1> On Living </h1>
     <p> This earth will grow cold,<br>
a star among stars <br>
               and one of the smallest,<br>
a gilded mote on blue velvetâ€” <br>
	  I mean this, our great earth.<br>
This earth will grow cold one day,<br>
not like a block of ice <br>
or a dead cloud even <br>
but like an empty walnut it will roll along
	  in pitch-black space...
     </p>
